## Introduction

Hi! I am Lyme. This page is my first blog, which is used to document my personal review of my English homework. Yep, I created the blog to promote my English skills indeed. I confirm that I will write these words by myself, not AI or translation application. So it may have some grammar issues. If you find it, please tell me :).

## The Homework

Today's essay is about the "Traditional Chinese Cuisine". And here are the original test requirements:

> 为了提高学生的生活实践能力，下周你校学生会将举办“中华传统美食”厨艺大赛。请你为学生会英文公众号写一篇英语推文，内容包括：1. 比赛时间、地点；2. 比赛内容、意义；3. 邀请参与并且宣传推广。

_To be honest, I decided to write the requirements in English at first, but my English is too poor to tackle it :(._

### Problems & Solutions

I had found some problems that needed to be solved after the teacher had **corrected**[^1] my homework. In the first paragraph, my context is:

> Next Friday afternoon, the competition of Chinese cuisine will be embarked on by Students' Union, whose place is located in the center of the school canteen.

My teacher underlined the words of "embarked on". Obviously it has some error, so I asked AI about it.

> 1. "Embark on" means to start something like a journey or project, but it’s not the right fit for a competition. Plus, it’s not typically used in passive voice ("will be embarked on").
> 2. "Students' Union" is correct, but in English, we usually say "the Students’ Union" (with "the") when referring to a specific group.
> 3. "Whose" refers to the Students’ Union, but it sounds like the Union itself is located in the canteen, which isn’t what you mean. You’re trying to say the competition’s location.
> 
> The sentence is a bit long and **clunky**. Splitting it or reordering it can help:
> 
> _"Next Friday afternoon, the Students’ Union will hold a Chinese cuisine competition in the center of the school canteen."_

And my teacher's version is:

_A cooking competition "Traditional Chinese Cuisine" will be held by the Students' Union at the school cafeteria running from 2 pm until 5 pm next Saturday._

Hmm, that is better, isn't it? So let's build up a few **phrases**[^2] for next time (This is so easy so I didn't write here :P).

Another problem is how to build up the second paragraph? I have a map: Cooking -> Judging -> **Awarding**[^3]. In my version I used "Active form" to list the requirements like "The competition offers one hour to participants to finish their unique dishes". But the teacher's version like "Competitors are required to ...", using the "Passive form". Whole sentence is:

_Competitors are required to cook a traditional dish unique to Chinese culture within the given time, followed by a brief introduction to the delicacy._

After that, _all the works will be rated and the winners will be awarded a **trophy**[^4]._ Okay, I have learnt how to refine my homework :).

At last, I need to fix a sentence from my version: "And the latest dinner gathers us stronger." (Yes, I used to plan that these competitors could enjoy their fruits in the end.) "Latest" sounds odd, and "gathers us stronger" isn't clear. So I could **modify**[^5] it:

1. "At the end, a final dinner brings us closer together."
2. "Afterward, we enjoy a dinner that strengthens our connection."
3. "Finally, the competitors share a meal to celebrate and grow closer."

Oh, to make the post more "TRUE", a sentence is recommended:

_Please forward the news to your classmates._

## Jottings[^6]

MY GOD. Writing the blog even close to kill me :(. I really made hundreds of grammar issues, and I feel that it's very hard to write English properly. Anyway, I had finished it, so, give myself a congratulation :).
